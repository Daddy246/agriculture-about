    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p> <b>Agriculture is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. </b></p>

  <p> <b>A soil type is a taxonomic unit in soil science. All soils that share a certain set of well-defined properties form a distinctive soil type. Soil type is a technical term of soil classification, the science that deals with the systematic categorization of soils. Every soil of the world belongs to a certain soil type. </b></p>

    <p><b>A crop is a plant or an animal product that is allowed to grow and also harvested for-profit purposes. The crops can be consumbed for daily uses as food like grains, vegetables, etc. and can be traded commercially. Most farmers do grow different types of crops in India and other countries on various farms. We can also grow some farm products in our gardens by following proper growing and harvesting processes. Soil plays an essential part in different crops to grow big.The agriculture science that studies crops is called Agronomy </b>

    <h2><marquee direction ="left">crops Rotation</marquee></h2>
    <p><b>Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area across a sequence of growing seasons. It reduces reliance on one set of nutrients, pest and weed pressure, and the probability of developing resistant pest and weeds.</b></p>

   <p><b> Water is an essential element for survival. About seventy per cent of the human body consists of water while plants contain almost 90 per cent of water. Still, we have to depend on some outside sources to fulfil the water requirements of our body.</b></p>

<p><b>Similarly, crops require water for their growth and development. The process of supplying water to the crops is known as irrigation.</b></p>

    <h2><marquee direction="left">Modern Techniques </marquee></h2>
      
     <p> <b>There are several modern and sustainable ways of doing productive farming; ways that will be beneficial to both farmers and consumers. Many biotechnologists and agricutural researchers come up with effective ideas to improve agricultural practices. However, their solutions and findings remain restricted to journals and other publications that are far from the reach of uneducated or local farmers.</b></p>

<p><b>Some of the modern techniques are:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>genetic manipulation</li>
<li>intensive tillage</li>
<li>monoculture</li>
<li>use of synthetic fertilizers</li>
<li>irrigation technologies</li>
<li>chemical pest control</li>
